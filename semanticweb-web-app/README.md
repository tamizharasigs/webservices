This project shows the basics for building a Semantic Web-based application by guiding you through some of the typical steps involved. This means:

* Styling your webpage using CSS
* Using client side scripting for manipulating the webpage
* Using server side scripting for mediating between your own triple store and others
* Posting information to your triple store
* Using reasoning facilities of your triple store

The code is documented and explains each of these steps.
